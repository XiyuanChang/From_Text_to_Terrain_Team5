This folder stores 5-classes based embeddings generated by MLM Bart models. i.e., we obtained the embeddings of all original PFAS-related text contents from the finetuned Bart models.

The Bart models are finetuned based on 5 PFAS contamination level classes: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High

And 3 configurations:
