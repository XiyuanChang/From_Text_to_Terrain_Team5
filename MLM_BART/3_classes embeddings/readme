This folder stores 3-classes based embeddings generated by MLM Bart models. i.e., we obtained the embeddings of all original PFAS-related text contents from the finetuned Bart models.

The Bart models are finetuned based on 3 PFAS contamination level classes: Low, Medium, High

And 3 configurations:
Landcover > Discharger
Discharger > Landcover
Discharger = Landcover
